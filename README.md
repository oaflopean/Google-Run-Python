Hey! There are a few python scripts in this repository.

script.py is a word sprint that counts the words in every text file in the folder its run, then compares the wordcount of those files at the end of a timer. To run this program, you need a folder with the script inside and your text files in the same folder.

script2.py is a query program that launches all your books in geany. Just modify the book library location and run the script to open a whole bookshelf of books at once.

download.py is for downloading the Gutenberg library. Install the requirements for this script with pip at the link below.

list.py is for making a list of books from the curated Copypasta library

You may need to make small changes to these files to get them working. the only requirement for download.py is found on this web page:
